# SPOJSolutions
This repository contains solution to SPOJ problems. The solutions are written in C++ language, credit to the solver has been given in documentation section in every source code.
Please always add a documentation at the top of the source code you submit.
The documentation you add must follow the following format:
/*
Name :- Name of the problem
ID :- ID of the problem
Link :- Link to the problem
Date :- Date of uploading the solution
By :- Name of the solver(if you take the solution from somewhere else than please mention the link of the source else the SPOJ profile link of the solver in parentheses next to the name)
*/

Also keep in mind :-
1. Please explain your algorithm if it is not obvious.
2. Comment against a line wherever neccessary.
3. If the solution follows from a standard algorithm it would be nice if you can add a link to a source(s) of learning it.
